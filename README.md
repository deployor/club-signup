This project is a simplified version of a previous voting app I created for highseas but havent published. I realized that the project might be difficult for people to understand, so I made a new repository with modifications to make it easier to demo.  You can find the other repositories on my profile they are all the same *project* to me though. This is not an update to the original project, but both repos are open. Its more purpose relevant to HackClub! First time dealing with production DB! ü§î

CREATE TABLE signups (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  signed_up BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  CONSTRAINT valid_email CHECK (email LIKE '%@fbi.gov') // Remove this row if u dont want to check mail domains
);

-- RLS
ALTER TABLE signups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

--  policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own signup" ON signups
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.email() = email);

-- polidy
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own signup" ON signups
